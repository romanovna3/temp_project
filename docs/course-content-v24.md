## 2) Learning the Game (`learning-the-game`)

### 1. Learning the Board: Ranks — `learning-the-game-1`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode**
  - **Coach title:** Play the correct move  
  - **Coach body:** White to play  
  - **Body HTML:** Squares on a chess board can be divided and understood according to ranks (side to side), files (up and down) and diagonals. Let's talk about ranks. There are 8 ranks on a chess board numbered from 1-8. Here we see a lone queen sitting on the 3rd rank. We will learn about her highness when we talk about the pieces. For now, to get a better feel for the board, let's try moving her all the way across the 3rd rank to the other side.
- **Read mode**
  - **Caption:** The queen shuffles all the way to the other side along the 3rd rank.
  - **Body (below moves):** [Missing – add Read mode body for Ranks here]

### 2. Learning the Board: Files — `learning-the-game-2`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach title: Play the correct move. Coach body: White to play. Body: Files are the sets of squares that go up and down on a chess board. There are 8 of them, lettered from a to h. Here, a queen sits on the d-file. Let's move her all the way down to the other side of the d-file.
- **Read mode:** Caption: I think you have the hang of it. | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 3. Learning the Board: Diagonals — `learning-the-game-3`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: There are lots of diagonals of varying sizes on a chess board. Here, the queen sits on the a1-h8 diagonal. Let's move her along it to the other side - the h8-square.
- **Read mode:** Caption: Note that all squares on a given diagonal must be of the same color - light or dark. | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 4. Getting to Know the Squares #1 — `learning-the-game-4`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: There are 64 squares on a chess board, each with their own unique letter-number coordinate. Let's practice moving a piece to a given square. Let's start by moving the queen to the d5-square.
- **Read mode:** Caption: Nice job. Notice the d5-square sits on the d-file and the 5th rank. | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 5. Getting to Know the Squares #2 — `learning-the-game-5`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: Now try moving the queen to the a2-square.

- **Read mode:** Caption: You got it. Now you understand the basic layout of the chess board! For more practice on coordinate recognition, check out Vision Drills on Chess.com | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 7. Meet the Rook — `learning-the-game-7`
- **Type:** info  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Read through this line and arrow through the moves. Body: Rooks, sometimes incorrectly referred to as castles due to their shape, are perhaps the easiest piece to understand. Rooks move as far as they like; up, down, or side to side along either ranks or files. Let's see it moving in a square from e4 up to e8, across to a8, down to a4, and back over to e4. This is how the rook moves around in straight lines across the board.
- **Read mode:** [None in lineReadModeBodyByKey]

### 8. Meet the Rook - Practice — `learning-the-game-8`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: Let's practice moving the rook up to the c7 square.
- **Read mode:** Caption: The rook is a very powerful piece, second only to the queen. Together, they make up the major pieces. | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 9. Meet the Bishop — `learning-the-game-9`
- **Type:** info  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Read through this line and arrow through the moves. Body: Meet the bishop. It moves only diagonally across one color complex - light or dark. Here we have a light-squared bishop. Let's see it moving along the light-squared diagonals. Notice a bishop must stay on the same color complex (in this case, the light-squares) for the entire game!
- **Read mode:** [None]

### 10. Meet the Bishop - Practice — `learning-the-game-10`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: Let's practice moving this dark-squared bishop along one of its favorite diagonals to the e5-square.
- **Read mode:** Caption: The bishop and knight are called minor pieces, and are essential components of your army. | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 11. Meet the Queen — `learning-the-game-11`
- **Type:** info  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Read through this line and arrow through the moves. Body: The queen is the most powerful piece on the board. She has the combined power to move like a bishop and rook and as far as she likes. Let's see her in action roaming around the board. The queen is the most powerful piece because of the great number of squares she can control, especially from the middle of the board!
- **Read mode:** [None]

### 12. Meet the Queen - Practice — `learning-the-game-12`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: Every chess piece can move backwards except for pawns (which we will cover soon). Let's move the queen diagonally like a bishop, back to the a2-square.
- **Read mode:** Caption (plain): Remember, the queen can go in any direction she likes, including up and down 1. Qg1 and side to side 1. Qd8 like a rook. | Caption (HTML): Remember, the queen can go in any direction she likes, including up and down <span class="inline-ply-chip" data-move="Qg1">1. Qg1</span> and side to side <span class="inline-ply-chip" data-move="Qd8">1. Qd8</span> like a rook. | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 13. Meet the Knight — `learning-the-game-13`
- **Type:** info  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Read through this line and arrow through the moves. Body: The knight is a little different. It does not move in a straight line, like the rest of the pieces. Instead, it moves in an 'L' shape; two squares in one direction followed by one square in another adjacent direction. The knight is the only piece you might say can jump over other pieces without capturing or disturbing them. Let's see the knight gallop around a little. Notice the knight can essentially jump over other pieces (of either color) without capturing or disturbing them. Knights are considered the most tricky piece because of its unique moving pattern.
- **Read mode:** [None]

### 14. Meet the Knight - Practice — `learning-the-game-14`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: This piece takes the most practice getting used to. Let's move the knight up to c6 in its signature L-shape.
- **Read mode:** Caption: From this square, the knight can jump to 8 different squares (all dark!). Let's see them: | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 15. Meet the King — `learning-the-game-15`
- **Type:** info  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Read through this line and arrow through the moves. Body: His majesty, the king moves one square in any direction he wishes - up or down, side to side, or diagonally. While it controls every square around it, its limited mobility makes it substantially less powerful than his royal counterpart, the queen. Let's see how he moves. The king's mobility is the most limited, and if you lose the king, you lose the game, as we will soon discuss. Therefore, the king requires protection throughout the game.
- **Read mode:** [None]

### 16. Meet the King - Practice — `learning-the-game-16`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: Let's see the king step one square to the side to the e3-square.
- **Read mode:** Caption: The king can move one square in any direction, like so: | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 17. Meet the Pawn — `learning-the-game-17`
- **Type:** info (movesInBody: introBodyHtml, moveExplanations[], closingBodyHtml)  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Read through this line and arrow through the moves. Intro: Pawns move up the board in a straight line, one square at a time. They are the only piece that cannot move backward. Capturing: Pawns capture diagonally. Initial two-square move: A pawn on its starting square (the 2nd and 7th ranks) has the option to move two squares forward instead of just one. Move explanations: (1) Since there is a pawn diagonally to ours, we may capture it like this! (2) Since the d-pawn is not on its starting square, it is restricted to moving just one square forward at a time. (3) Since the a-pawn was sitting on its starting square, it can move up two squares instead of one! Closing: Note the h-pawns are blocking each other, so neither may move.
- **Read mode:** [None]

### 18. Meet the Pawn - Practice #1 — `learning-the-game-18`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: The pawn is not on its starting square, so it may only move one square forward at a time. Try it for yourself!
- **Read mode:** Caption: Pretty simple! Next we will practice capturing with the pawn. | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 19. Meet the Pawn - Practice #2 — `learning-the-game-19`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: Here Black's rook can be captured by the white pawn!
- **Read mode:** Caption: It's always a good thing to take your opponent's pieces, especially with a pawn! | Body below moves: [Missing]

### 20. Pawn Promotion — `learning-the-game-20`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: Every pawn contains the hidden potential to transform into a queen, bishop, rook, or knight when it reaches the other side of the board (the 8th rank for a white pawn, or the 1st rank for a black pawn). This is called pawn promotion. Most often, players opt to promote to a queen because the queen is the most powerful piece. Let's practice promoting a far-advanced pawn to a queen.
- **Read mode:** Caption: Just like that, a new queen enters the game which is great news for White. | Body below moves: [Missing]

## 3) The Opening (`the-opening`)

### 1. The Dream Opening — `the-opening-1`
- **Type:** info (movesInBody)  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Read through this line and arrow through the moves. Intro + moveExplanations (8 moves) + closing re dream opening and castling.

### 2. The Dream Opening - Practice — `the-opening-2`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Play the correct move / White to play. Body: Now let's test your memory. Make the best developing moves possible in the same order you just saw in the previous variation. Hint: Control the center with pawns. Knights before bishops. Bring in the queen to prepare to castle queenside.

- **Learn mode:** Intro (10 rules) + moveExplanations (2) + closing.
- **Read mode:** [None]

### 5. Leave the Queen at Home! — `the-opening-5`
- **Type:** (no quiz/info flag; has moves)  
- **Learn mode:** [Default coach / no specific content in info or quiz]  
- **Read mode body:** Let's learn what the popular opening, the Queen's Gambit, looks like when played well by both sides! d4, like e4, is a fantastic first move. It controls the center with a pawn, and prepares the development of White's dark-squared bishop. One of Black's most common replies, following suit by occupying the center with a pawn right away. White lunges forward with a second pawn towards the center of the board, and threatens to capture Black's d-pawn! Black decides not to capture on c4 as after White will recapture on c4 with the bishop, and has excellent control of the center with both pawns! Instead, Black opts to defend their central pawn with 2...e6. This is called the Queen's Gambit Declined.

### 6. Early Castling in the Ruy Lopez — `the-opening-6`
- **Read mode body:** Now let's see one of the oldest and most common openings at all levels: the Ruy Lopez, or Spanish opening. Pay special attention to how opening principles are observed, especially rule #5 – castling the king early. Let's see if you can learn and remember the first moves of this ancient opening. A perfect move; controlling the center and making way for the queen and bishop. As we've already seen, this move does many things: Develops a piece; Controls the center; Brings the king one move closer to castling to safety; Attacks a pawn! Black defends. This is the starting position of the Ruy Lopez Opening which has been played hundreds of thousands of times. In addition to developing a piece and preparing to castle, the point of this move is to attack Black's knight – an important defender of Black's center. In this way, this bishop move indirectly controls the center!

### 7. Learn the Queen's Gambit — `the-opening-7`
- **Read mode body:** (Same as the-opening-5 – Queen's Gambit Declined copy.)

### 8. Don't Try Scholar's Mate! — `the-opening-8`
- **Read mode body:** Let's take a look at another example of what can go wrong if one side insists on going for checkmate with the queen too early. A strong first move, occupying the center, stopping white from playing d4 next, and facilitating kingside development. White brings out the queen as early as move 2, threatening to win our central pawn. So, we defend it by developing a piece. Remember, it's important to notice and react appropriately to your opponent's threats. White is trying to checkmate us on the f7 square. If we don't defend, next would end the game and we would lose. Let's learn how to defend against this popular try at the beginner level. White is going for Scholar's Mate with Queen to f7 next, which we saw in the first lesson. This can be a quick way to catch unwitting opponents off guard. If Black isn't careful and plays something like 3...Nf6 attacking the queen, White would be able to give checkmate already on move four with 4. Qxf7#. But we see White's threat and are ready to punish them for breaking the opening rules. ...g6 defends against the checkmate threat on f7, and forces White to waste another move on the queen, otherwise she will be captured.

## 4) Tactics & Strategy (`tactics-strategy`)

All 8 lines have **Read mode body** only (no info/quiz Learn mode content in codebase).

### 1. Tactics: Double Attack #1 — `tactics-strategy-1`
- **Read mode body:** For our first tactic, let's examine the double attack, also called a fork. A double attack is when one piece attacks two enemy pieces at the same time. In this position, the rook can attack both the enemy bishop and knight because they are sitting on the same rank! 1. Rf7 — Rook to f7 double attacks the bishop and knight, and Black cannot save them both. This means on the next move, White can capture one of them.

### 2. Tactics: Double Attack #2 — `tactics-strategy-2`
- **Read mode body:** Here it's White's move, and there are actually two different double attacks possible. One of them is Knight to e7, double attacking the king and queen. A double attack involving the enemy king is particularly effective because it comes with check, meaning your opponent will need to spend a move escaping the check. 1. Ne7+ — Double attacking the king and queen is the best move in this position because we win the queen. However, the other double attack in this position is the move 1. b4 which attacks both knights at the same time. Under normal circumstances, Black would not be able to save them both. 1... Kf7 2. Nxc8 — We have chosen the better of the two double attacks, and we have won the enemy queen!

### 3. Tactics: Absolute Pin — `tactics-strategy-3`
- **Read mode body:** Let's move on to the next tactic: the pin. A pin occurs when a bishop, rook, or queen attacks an enemy piece, disabling it from moving because there's a better piece behind it. 1. Bb5 — What a move! With this move, there are actually two pins in the position: (1) The white rook pins the black knight to the king. (2) The white bishop pins the black rook to the king. Neither the black rook nor the black knight can legally move, because it's against the rules to put your own king in check! That's why this kind of pin is called an absolute pin.

### 4. Tactics: Relative Pin — `tactics-strategy-4`
- **Read mode body:** The second type of pin is called a relative pin. 1. Bg5 — The bishop attacks the knight, and this time the enemy queen sits behind it. In this position, it would be a bad idea to move the black knight, though not illegal. In some rare instances, it can be a good idea to move pieces in relative pins if they create a strong counterattack. 1... Nd5 2. Bxd8 — However in most positions, like this one, if the knight were to move, we would simply capture the queen and likely win the game.

### 5. Tactics: Relative Pin in the Queen's Gambit — `tactics-strategy-5`
- **Read mode body:** The Queen's Gambit opening features a relative pin like we just saw in the early stages of the game. Do you remember how it goes? 1. d4 – In the Queen's Gambit, White grabs the center with the queen's pawn on the first move. 1... d5 – Black responds in turn. 2. c4 – White puts pressure on Black's center by placing a second pawn in the center. 2... e6 – Black defends their center. 3. Nc3 – White develops their queenside pieces, starting with the knight towards the center, again adding pressure to Black's center. 3... Nf6 – Black develops a knight and defends the center simultaneously.

### 6. Tactics: Skewer — `tactics-strategy-6`
- **Read mode body:** A skewer is in some ways the opposite of a pin. A pin features a weaker piece sitting in front of, and shielding a more powerful piece behind it. A skewer sees a more powerful piece attacked and forced to retreat, revealing an attack on another vulnerable piece behind it on the same rank, file, or diagonal. 1. Re1+ — In this position, whoever's turn it is to move will win the game due to a skewer. Fortunately for White, it is their turn, and rook to e1 wins the enemy rook by attacking the king and forcing it to move out of the way.

### 7. Tactics: A Deadly Rook Skewer — `tactics-strategy-7`
- **Read mode body:** Here is an example of a skewer occurring from a more realistic position. Here we can notice the queen and rook are lined up on the same file – prime conditions for a rook skewer. 1. Re1 – White skewers the queen and rook along the e-file. Black must move the queen. 1... Qg6 – Black saves the queen but leaves the rook undefended. 2. Rxe8# – White captures the rook with checkmate. The skewer won material and finished the game.

### 8. Tactics: Skewer - The Infamous Endgame Skewer — `tactics-strategy-8`
- **Read mode body:** Skewers are especially common in the endgame when the king is exposed. Here we see a classic example: a pawn promotes with check, and the new queen skewers the enemy king and rook. 1. a8=Q+ – The pawn promotes to a queen with check. Black's king must move. 1... Kf4 – The king steps aside. 2. Qxh1 – The queen captures the rook, winning the game. This is the infamous endgame skewer: the king was forced to move, exposing the piece behind it.

## 5) The Endgame (`the-endgame`)

### 1. Endgame Checkmates: Ladder Mate — `the-endgame-1`
- **Read mode body:** (Queen's Gambit Declined placeholder copy – likely needs real ladder-mate copy.)

### 2. Endgame Checkmates: The Queen Checkmate — `the-endgame-2`
- **Read mode body:** (Ruy Lopez placeholder – likely needs real queen-checkmate copy.)

### 3. Endgame Checkmates: The Rook Mate — `the-endgame-3`
- **Type:** info  
- **Learn mode:** Coach: Read through this line and arrow through the moves. Body: Endgame Checkmates: The Rook Mate. With only a king and rook left, you can force checkmate by driving the enemy king to the edge of the board. The two rooks (or rook and king) work together to shrink the space available to the enemy king until it is checkmated. This is one of the most important endgame patterns to learn. Let's see how it's done.
- **Read mode body:** (Double-attack/fork placeholder – likely needs real rook-mate copy.)

### 4. The Rook Mate - Practice — `the-endgame-4`
- **Read mode body:** (Double attack #2 placeholder – likely needs real copy.)

### 3. Final Review #2 — `bringing-it-together-3`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Body: White's king is safe in the center for now, so castling immediately isn't strictly necessary. Wesley has a nice space advantage and with his next aggressive move, takes even more space and gives one of his pieces a great square to come forward to. What did he play?
- **Read mode:** Caption (HTML): A fantastic idea, giving the d2-knight the c4 square to hop to... (readModeMoveWhite: c5)

### 4. Final Review #3 — `bringing-it-together-4`
- **Type:** quiz  
- **Learn mode:** Body: After a dominant display of flawless opening and middlegame strategy from Wesley So, he arrived at this position in which all of Black's pieces are tied down or out of the game.
