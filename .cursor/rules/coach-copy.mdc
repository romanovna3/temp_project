# Coach bubble copy

**Do not change the copy in the coach bubble** (the card that shows above the main content on quiz/info lines) unless the user explicitly asks you to.

- **Quiz lines**: Always use the standard coach copy:
  - `coachTitle`: `'Play the correct move'`
  - `coachBody`: `'White to play'` (or `'Black to play'` if the position is Black to move)
- Put any custom prompt, scenario text, or question **only in `bodyHtml`** (the text below the coach bubble), not in `coachTitle` or `coachBody`.
- **Info lines**: Keep existing `coachMessage` (e.g. "Review the content below and continue when you're ready") unless the user asks to change it.

When adding or editing quiz content (e.g. in `quizLineContentByKey`), leave coach fields as above and put user-provided narrative or questions in `bodyHtml` only.
